# Collections - Tasks

## Task 1: Arrays
Work with fixed-size arrays in Go.

**Requirements:**
- Create arrays of different types (int, string, bool)
- Access array elements by index
- Iterate over arrays using for loops
- Demonstrate array length and capacity
- Show array initialization methods

## Task 2: Slices
Work with dynamic slices in Go.

**Requirements:**
- Create slices using different methods
- Append elements to slices
- Slice existing slices (slicing)
- Use built-in functions: len(), cap(), append()
- Demonstrate slice capacity and length

## Task 3: Maps
Work with key-value pairs using maps.

**Requirements:**
- Create maps with different key and value types
- Add, update, and delete map entries
- Check if a key exists in a map
- Iterate over maps using range
- Demonstrate map initialization

## Task 4: Collection Operations
Perform common operations on collections.

**Requirements:**
- Find the maximum and minimum values in slices
- Count occurrences of elements
- Filter elements based on conditions
- Sort slices (both ascending and descending)
- Remove duplicates from slices

## Task 5: Nested Collections
Work with collections containing other collections.

**Requirements:**
- Create slices of slices (2D slices)
- Create maps with slice values
- Create slices with map values
- Iterate over nested collections
- Perform operations on nested structures

## Task 6: Practical Application
Create a simple inventory management system.

**Requirements:**
- Store items with properties (name, price, quantity)
- Add and remove items from inventory
- Search for items by name
- Calculate total inventory value
- Display inventory statistics

## How to complete these tasks:

1. Navigate to the `student/` directory
2. Create your code in `main.go`
3. Run your code: `go run main.go`


## Testing Your Code

Run your program:
```bash
cd student/
go run main.go
```

You should see output demonstrating all collection operations.
