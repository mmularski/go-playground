# Basic Structs - Tasks

## Task 1: Create Simple Structs
Create basic structs with different field types.

**Requirements:**
- Create a struct for a Person with name, age, and email
- Create a struct for a Rectangle with width and height
- Create a struct for a Book with title, author, and year
- Initialize structs using different methods
- Print struct values

## Task 2: Struct Fields and Tags
Work with struct fields and tags.

**Requirements:**
- Create structs with different field types (int, string, bool, float64)
- Use field tags for JSON serialization
- Access struct fields using dot notation
- Modify struct fields
- Demonstrate field visibility (exported vs unexported)

## Task 3: Struct Initialization
Practice different ways to initialize structs.

**Requirements:**
- Initialize structs using struct literals
- Initialize structs using field names
- Initialize structs using positional values
- Create structs with default values
- Use the new() function to create structs

## Task 4: Nested Structs
Work with structs containing other structs.

**Requirements:**
- Create nested structs (structs within structs)
- Access nested struct fields
- Initialize nested structs
- Create structs with slice and map fields
- Demonstrate struct composition

## Task 5: Anonymous Structs
Create and use anonymous structs.

**Requirements:**
- Create anonymous structs for one-time use
- Use anonymous structs in function parameters
- Create anonymous structs with embedded structs
- Demonstrate when to use anonymous vs named structs

## Task 6: Struct Methods
Create methods for your structs.

**Requirements:**
- Create methods with value receivers
- Create methods with pointer receivers
- Demonstrate the difference between value and pointer receivers
- Create getter and setter methods
- Create methods that modify struct state

## How to complete these tasks:

1. Navigate to the `student/` directory
2. Create your code in `main.go`
3. Run your code: `go run main.go`


## Testing Your Code

Run your program:
```bash
cd student/
go run main.go
```

You should see output demonstrating all struct concepts.
