# Type Assertions - Tasks

## Task 1: Basic Type Assertions
Create and use basic type assertions.

**Requirements:**
- Create a function that accepts `interface{}`
- Use type assertions to check for different types
- Handle both successful and failed assertions
- Demonstrate the comma ok idiom

## Task 2: Type Switches
Create type switches to handle multiple types.

**Requirements:**
- Create a function that uses type switches
- Handle at least 5 different types
- Include a default case
- Demonstrate type switch syntax

## Task 3: Interface Type Assertions
Check if values implement specific interfaces.

**Requirements:**
- Create interfaces with methods
- Create types that implement the interfaces
- Use type assertions to check interface implementation
- Handle cases where interface is not implemented

## Task 4: Safe Type Assertions
Create functions that safely handle type assertions.

**Requirements:**
- Create functions that return values and success status
- Handle type assertion failures gracefully
- Provide default values for failed assertions
- Demonstrate error handling patterns

## Task 5: Complex Type Assertions
Work with complex types and nested structures.

**Requirements:**
- Create functions that handle slices and maps
- Use type assertions with custom structs
- Handle nested interface{} values
- Demonstrate complex type checking

## Task 6: Practical Application
Create a simple data processor using type assertions.

**Requirements:**
- Create a function that processes different data types
- Use type switches to handle various inputs
- Create a data processor that can handle mixed types
- Demonstrate real-world usage

## How to complete these tasks:

1. Navigate to the `student/` directory
2. Create your code in `main.go`
3. Run your code: `go run main.go`


## Testing Your Code

Run your program:
```bash
cd student/
go run main.go
```

You should see output demonstrating all type assertion concepts.
