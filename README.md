## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

### **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd go-playground
   ```

2. **Start with the first exercise**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/01-basics/01-hello/
   ```

3. **Read the overview**
   ```bash
   cat overview.md
   ```

4. **Complete the tasks**
   ```bash
   cd student/
   # Edit main.go to implement solutions
   ```

5. **Run your code**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

6. **Write and run tests**
   ```bash
   # Edit main_test.go
   go test
   go test -v
   go test -cover
   ```

### **Exercise Structure**

Each exercise follows this pattern:

```
exercise-name/
├── overview.md          # Concept explanation with examples
├── tasks.md            # Practical exercises to complete
└── student/            # Your workspace (gitignored)
    ├── main.go         # Your solution code
    └── main_test.go    # Your tests
```
